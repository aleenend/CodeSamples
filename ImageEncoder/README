This is code from my first project in 1020 with Dr. Feaster. It takes a message and encodes it into a ppm image.
I do not have the code to decode the message as that wasn't part of the project, but I'm submitting this code
primarily to show off the part that parses and recreates the ppm image. You may notice the output image is a
slightly different shade from the original. That change is due to the message being encoded in the pixel data.

I have provided a Makefile for easy compiling/running. Commands are as follows:
To compile: make
To run: make run
To delete unneccesary files: make clean

I have provided a ppm image to test the code with. It works with any ppm image.
If you wish to test it with your own image, you must manually run the code.
To do so: ./encode.out <imageName.ppm> <outputName.ppm>
