This is code from my tenth lab in 2120 with Professor Hill. The lab10.cpp file belongs to him and was provided for
the lab. I wrote the code within permute.h. It takes numbers from a text file and permutes them three
different ways based on functions I wrote. The explanations for where the permute function ideas came from are within
the code itself.

I have provided a Makefile for easy compiling/running. Commands are as follows:
To compile: make
To run: make run
To delete unneccesary files: make clean

The text file is a very important part of testing this because the driver specifically looks for it. Please make sure
you have downloaded all of the files in this folder for testing. If you want to test different numbers, just edit the 
numbers within the text file.
